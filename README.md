## Project Overview

This project is part of the Flutter Mentorship program (Week 5), focusing on **debugging**, **testing**, and **validation**. I identified and fixed critical bugs in three widgets, added comprehensive test coverage, and implemented production-ready validation logic.

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality

- User registration with comprehensive form validation
- Shopping cart with quantity management and discount calculation
- Weather display with async data fetching and unit conversion
- Real-time validation feedback
- Error handling and edge case management

### Testing Coverage

- Unit tests for validation logic and data models
- Widget tests for UI state management
- Integration tests for async operations
- Edge case testing (100% discount, empty states, invalid inputs)

## Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| **Framework** | Flutter |
| **Language** | Dart |
| **Testing** | Flutter Test Framework, Mockito |

## Widget 1: User Registration Form

### Bug Description

The registration form had critical validation issues:

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Email validation | Accepted invalid formats like `a@` or `@b` |
| Password validation | Allowed weak passwords without uppercase, digit, or symbol |
| Form validation | Submitted even with empty or invalid fields |
| Missing tests | No unit or widget tests to verify validation |

### Solution Implemented

#### Validation Logic

- Implemented regex-based email validation: `^[\w-]+(\.[\w-]+)*@([\w-]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,7}$`
- Added strong password rules:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one digit
  - At least one special character
- Applied form validation before submission using `_formKey.currentState?.validate()`
- Enabled real-time validation with `AutovalidateMode.onUserInteraction`

#### UI Improvements

- Added SnackBar feedback for success/error messages
- Inline error messages for each field
- Removed old "bug warning" banner widgets

#### Tests Added

- Unit tests for email and password validator functions
- Widget tests for form interaction and validation flow
- Edge case testing (subdomain emails, trimmed spaces, weak passwords)

### Screenshots

| State | Description | Screenshot |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Empty Fields | All fields empty validation | ![Empty Fields](assets/screenshots/form/empty_fields.png) |
| Full Name Error | Invalid full name format | ![Full Name Error](assets/screenshots/form/full_name_error.png) |
| Invalid Email | Email validation error | ![Invalid Email](assets/screenshots/form/please_enter_a_valid_email.png) |
| Weak Password | Password strength requirements | ![Weak Password](assets/screenshots/form/password_is_too_weak.png) |
| Password Mismatch | Passwords do not match | ![Password Mismatch](assets/screenshots/form/passwords_do_not_match.png) |
| Success | Registration successful | ![Success](assets/screenshots/form/registration_successful.png) |

### Edge Cases Tested

- Email with subdomains (e.g., `user@mail.example.co`)
- Email/password with leading/trailing spaces (auto-trimmed)
- Password length exactly 7 characters (rejected)
- Password missing special symbol (rejected)
- Password missing digit (rejected)
- Password missing uppercase letter (rejected)
- All valid inputs (registration success)

## Widget 2: Shopping Cart

### Bug Description

The shopping cart had multiple critical bugs:

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Duplicate items | Adding the same item twice created a new entry instead of increasing quantity |
| Discount logic | Discount calculation was incorrect (added instead of subtracted) |
| Total amount | Total included discount incorrectly, causing inflated totals |
| Edge cases | No handling for 100% discount, empty cart, or quantity limits |
| Tests | No unit or widget tests for cart logic |

### Solution Implemented

#### Logic Fixes

- Fixed `addItem()` to update quantity for duplicate items instead of creating new entries
- Corrected discount formula: `price * quantity * discount`
- Fixed total calculation: `(subtotal - totalDiscount).clamp(0, double.infinity)`

#### Edge Case Protection

- Prevents quantity < 0
- Clamps quantity between 1 and 99
- Prevents discount > subtotal
- Shows "FREE ðŸŽ‰" when discount = 100%
- Displays "Cart is empty" message when cleared

#### UI Enhancements

- Wrapped layout in `SingleChildScrollView` for responsive design
- Added flexible row to avoid overflow on small screens
- Improved discount visibility with color coding
- Better visual feedback for cart operations

#### Tests Added

- Widget tests for adding items
- Duplicate item handling tests
- Clear cart functionality tests
- 100% discount edge case tests
- Quantity limit validation tests

### Screenshots

| State | Description | Screenshot |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Before Fix | Failing state with bugs | ![Error State](assets/screenshots/shopping_cart/error_cart_shopping.png) |
| After Fix | Success state with correct calculations | ![Success State](assets/screenshots/shopping_cart/success_cart_shopping.png) |

### Test Coverage

| Test Case | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Add Item | Adds product and updates subtotal correctly | âœ… Passed |
| Add Duplicate | Increases quantity instead of creating duplicate entry | âœ… Passed |
| Clear Cart | Removes all items and shows empty message | âœ… Passed |
| 100% Discount | Displays "FREE ðŸŽ‰" for fully discounted items | âœ… Passed |
| Quantity Limits | Prevents quantity below 0 or above 99 | âœ… Passed |

## Widget 3: Weather Display

### Overview

The Weather Display widget demonstrates **asynchronous data fetching**, **state management**, **unit conversion**, and **error handling** in a production-ready implementation.

### Features

- City dropdown selection
- Asynchronous weather data fetching via simulated API
- Loading, error, and success UI states
- Celsius â†” Fahrenheit temperature toggle
- Retry and refresh functionality
- Full null-safety and input validation

### Architecture

The widget integrates four core layers:

1. **`WeatherData` (Model)**: Defines temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition metadata
2. **`WeatherService` (Simulated API)**: Asynchronously provides mock weather data for city selections
3. **`WeatherConverter` (Utility)**: Handles temperature conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit
4. **`_WeatherDisplayState` (Controller)**: Manages rendering logic, user interactions, and async states

### State Flow

1. On initialization, weather data for the default city is requested
2. A **loading indicator** appears during data fetching
3. On success, a **weather card** displays formatted data
4. On failure, an **error UI** appears with retry options
5. Users can change cities or toggle temperature units dynamically

### Error Handling

The widget gracefully manages all error scenarios:

- Invalid or missing city names
- Malformed or incomplete API responses
- Simulated network exceptions or timeouts
- Clear, user-friendly feedback without crashes

### Edge Cases Covered

- City names with whitespace or mixed casing
- Malformed or special-character input triggering error UI
- Simulated API timeouts and delayed responses
- Rapid consecutive refresh/toggle actions (race-condition safety)
- Missing or null service fields without breaking UI
- Synchronization of async updates to avoid inconsistent visuals

### Tests Implemented

#### Widget Tests

- Loading indicator display on initialization
- Correct display of fetched weather data
- Error message display when service fails
- Temperature unit toggle (Celsius â†” Fahrenheit)
- Multiple asynchronous updates without race conditions

#### Unit Tests

- Temperature conversion accuracy (`WeatherConverter`)
- Data model parsing logic
- Default value handling

#### Service Tests

- Valid city input handling
- Invalid city input handling
- Empty input handling without crashes

### Screenshots

| State | Description | Screenshot |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Success | Weather data successfully loaded | ![Weather Success](assets/screenshots/weather_display/success.png) |
| Error | Error UI for invalid city selection | ![Weather Error](assets/screenshots/weather_display/error.png) |

### Test Summary

All weather-related tests pass successfully, confirming:

- UI reliability and user feedback
- Null-safe asynchronous programming
- Modular, testable architecture
- 100% pass rate across all test suites
